# Bikesharing

## Overview

This purpose of this project is to initiate the beginning a business plan based on bikesharing in New York City. After visiting the city and using these bikes, the client believes a similar venture would be profitable in her home town. Data from NYC Citi Bike August of 2019 was used to create the following analysis.

Resources used:
- Tableau Public
- Python
- Data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

The first page of the Tableau story shows the starting stations of the bikes ridden in August 2019. Knowing where the bikes are used in New York could give helpful insight as to where the client should focus in her home town.

Page two of the story provides the gender breakdown of bike usage into three categories including male, female, and unknown. The second image on the page breaks that information down further and illustrates the gender usage between subscribers and nonsubscribers. This image tells us that male subscribers are the most frequent users, and that usage between male and female subscribers peaks during the week days, specifically on Thursdays.

Page three of the story describes bike usage by hour per each weekday. This gives insight as to when the bikes are most used. The blue table shows usage by all users, while the yellow table shows usage broken down by gender. Both tables suggest that bikes are most often ridden during common commute hours, between 7-9am and 4-7pm. Backing up the information from the previous page, the yellow table illustrates that more males use the bikes than females.

The last page of the story describes how long bikes are used for at a given time. The tables show all users and users by gender. The top table shows that the majority of bike rides are less than ten minutes in length, but can range up to several hours. The bottom table reinforces the previous tablesâ€™ insights of gender usage. Male users strongly outnumber female and unknown users, though the length of usage trends the same for all users, peaking at 5, 6, and 15 minutes for males, females, and unknown users respectively.

## Summary

While knowing who is using the rental bikes and where is crucial information for the business, investors will want to know potential costs of running these bikes. Including data such a pricing and off-season ride usage will give investors and idea of what kind of cash flow they can expect throughout the year. Additional tables that were made describe bike utilization and those due for repairs. Providing this information before they ask will help put investors at ease.
